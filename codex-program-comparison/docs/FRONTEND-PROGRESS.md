# Frontend Progress

## [Prompt 7] - [Date placeholder]
- Initialized React + Vite + TypeScript app under `frontend/` with routing for dashboard, compare, store, cart, login, register, and portfolio (additional feature).
- Built design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows) with light/dark themes, global CSS variables, and `ThemeProvider` + toggle.
- Added UI kit components (Button, Input, Card, Modal, Spinner, Toast) and layout shell (Header, Sidebar, Footer) with responsive nav.
- Created pages with demo content for dashboard, crypto comparison, store/cart demo checkout, auth forms, and portfolio/alerts showcase.
- Implemented axios API client with env-driven base URL and auth token helpers; prepared for backend integration and SignalR wiring.
- Next up: connect to real API responses, add state/store layer, integrate auth flow and live price streams, and add component/e2e tests.
