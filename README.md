# AI Crypto Site Comparison
Three AI agents each built the same crypto website in their own folder (`claude-program-comparison`, `codex-program-comparison`, `gemini-program-comparison`) using an identical workflow. The goal was to compare different aspects of development across the models. After implementation, every project was debugged with AI as well.
